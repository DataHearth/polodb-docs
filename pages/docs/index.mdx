# Introduction

Welcome to PoloDB!

## What is PoloDB?

PoloDB is a library written in Rust that implements a lightweight MongoDB. PoloDB has no dependency(except for libc), so it can be easily run on most platform(thanks for Rust Language). The data of PoloDB is stored in a file. The file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compaitible. The API of PoloDB is very similar to MongoDB.
Itâ€™s very easy to learn and use.
