# Introduction

PoloDB is a library written in Rust
that implements a lightweight [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

# Features

- Simple and Lightweight
- Easy to learn and use
  - NoSQL
  - MongoDB-like API
- Cross-Platform
- Multiple backends
  - Filesystem(WAL)
  - Memory
  - IndexedDB(WIP)

# Backends

PoloDB designs an abstract layer for the computation and the store backend.
It supports different backends naturally.

## Filesystem Backend

With the filesystem backend, PoloDB stores data in ONE file.
All the data are saved persistently on the disk.

It's designed to be flexible, universal, and easy to be searched.
All the data are encoded in [bson](https://bsonspec.org/) format and stored in the PoloDB's btree format.

PoloDB uses WAL(write-ahead logging) to implement transactional writing and protect your data from program crashes.

## Memory Backend

With the memory backend, all the data all stored in memory, making PoloDB a pure memory database.

# Platform

Theoretically, PoloDB supports all platforms that the Rust compiler
supports.
But PoloDB is a personal project currently.
Limited by my time, I have only compiled and tested on the following platforms:

- macOS Big Sur x64
- Linux x64 (Tested on Fedora 32)
- Windows 10 x64
